GEMMLIB VDI call in USERDEF

GEMLIB is full safe thread VDI AES lib, for this most table are include in the stack for VDI call. 
This table are quite huge since NVDI is able to manage higher tables size.

USERDEF use supervisor stack that is very small with TOS systems and absolutely not compatible with
GEMLIB. To fix this issue we have defined new call like "udef_v_gtext()" used exactly as "v_gtext()" 
call but not using the stack. This call is not safe thread (even if shared userdef the code will be safe as
in supervisor the system will not interrupt the USERDEF!).
New functions start with "udef_" and finish with the standard name. 
This is the clean way to fix this problem but to help with your development and if you not need safe thread 
feature you can just define "VDI_USERDEF_COMPAT" in your compil option it will redefine critical VDI functions 
using too much the stack.
